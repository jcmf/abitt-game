  "readme": "# gribbl\na webification technologies\n\n## What is this thing?\n\nThis thing is a command-line tool and gulp plugin that compiles a\nplain `.html` file (or a `.jade` template) into a single self-contained\n`.html` file.\n\n* Scripts and stylesheets are inlined into the appropriate tag.\n* Resources used by scripts (such as `require()`d modules) are inlined\n  via Browserify.\n* Images, fonts, and other hyperlinked resources are inlined via\n  `data:` URIs.\n\nThis project's ridiculous name comes from [a Bob the Angry Flower\ncomic strip](http://www.angryflower.com/aposter.html).  No, I can't\njustify it.  I figured it wouldn't be taken already, and it certainly\nwasn't.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Jacques Frechet\n\n### The MIT License (MIT)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
