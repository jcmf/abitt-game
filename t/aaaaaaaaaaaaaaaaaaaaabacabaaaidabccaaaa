Don't you worry about counterfeit vanilla?

  a. Yes.
  b. No.
> c. Is that a thing?

#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabacabaaaidabc

Absolutely!  There's this chemical, coumarin, that has a really intense vanilla flavor, even more intense than actual vanilla.  It's prescribed as a blood thinner, and it's also pretty commonly used as rat poison, because it kills by causing internal bleeding.  And sometimes it's abused by unscrupulous taste-criminals!

  a. Wow, neat!
  b. Gah, that's horrifying!
> c. I think you're confused about the difference between coumarin and coumadin.

#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabacabaaaidabcc

Wait, really?

> a. Yeah, see, couma<em>rin</em> is the thing that shows up in fake vanilla, and couma<em>din</em> (also known as warfarin) is the blood-thinning drug that doubles as rat poison (though it isn't technically poisonous of course, just harmful in large doses, like many drugs).  They're similar, and the one is used to make the other, but they're not actually the same thing.
  b. No, not really.

#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabacabaaaidabcca

Wow!  So the vanilla stuff is fine, is what you're saying.

> a. Oh no!  It causes liver and kidney damage, and it's banned as a food additive by the FDA.  It's legal in Mexico, though.

#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabacabaaaidabccaa

Gosh, I did not realize that!  Thanks, I learned something today!

> a. No no, thank <em>you</em>.

#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabacabaaaidabccaaa

Okay, looks like that's it.  Thank you for playing this game, Emily.

> a. My pleasure.
  b. You're welcome.
  c. What a satisfying conclusion!
  d. Hold on, I have a question!
