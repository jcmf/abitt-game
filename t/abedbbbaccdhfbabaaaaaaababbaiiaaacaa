#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiia

Good idea!  So I believe the deal is that you want to put the heel of your hand pretty much exactly between the nipples.

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiiaa

Now all you have to do is press down so hard that you crush their heart.

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiiaaac

Emergency medical technicians.  You remembered to call 911, right?

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiiaaaca

It's okay, somebody over by the drinking fountain called them and they're on their way.  But try to remember to get that started earlier next time, okay?  This is not an ideal situation you've gotten yourself into here.
