Two identical twins go out to a bar, drink identical drink after identical drink, and while identically roaring drunk decide to drive back to their identical homes in their identical cars.  As they drive home, side by side (they are neighbors), they happen to run a red light.  Unfortunately a small child is crossing the street!  At the last moment, both twins see the child and brake and swerve and take every possible evasive action, but sadly it is too late and the first twin hits and kills the child!!!  The second twin comes safely to a stop without hitting anybody.  Who is to blame for the child's death?

What?  Why do you think that?

> a. It was clear from the way you told the story that they were trying to stay sober, but <em>fate</em> intervened!

#aaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaa

Okay but what if I told you a similar story about a similar set of twins only <em>these</em> twins were <em>definitely</em> trying to get drunk?

Actually, if you're in a movie theater, there's a good chance that there's an AED in the lobby.  You might want to grab that first.

> a. What's an AED?
  b. Good idea, I'll go look for it!
  c. Good idea, I'll send someone to fetch it and do CPR in the meantime!

#aaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

It's an Automatic External Defribrillator.  It's a little doodad that can sense when a heart is malfunctioning and shock it back into its normal rhythm.

> a. Wow, that sounds super handy!  I would totally go look for one.

Sure, there's a little diagram on there, and... wait, these go under the clothes, don't they?

> a. Nope!  We're not doing this.  Sorry.
  b. No problem, I pull their shirt up.
  c. Wow, this is intense.  Maybe I should pay attention to what the voice is saying.

#aaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

That is okay!  Nobody is going to make you do anything you don't feel comfortable doing.

> a. Thank you.
  b. Aren't you supposed to, like, tell me that they might die if I don't do this?

#aaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Okay, looks like that's it.  Thank you for playing this game, Emily.

  a. My pleasure.
  b. You're welcome.

What seems to be the problem?

  a. I'm trying to copy and paste that email address, but it's kinda hard to select the text because of how it's a hyperlink.

#aaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadcbb

My goodness, so it is!  Here, try this one: <a href="mailto:REDACTED@lolbird.com"><span class="redacted">REDACTED</span>@lolbird.com</a>

  a. Thanks!
> b. Hey, um, the first part is still blacked out.

#aaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadcbbb

Oh!  In that case, I recommend you use this one: <a href="mailto:REDACTED@lolbird.com">REDACTED@<span class="redacted">lolbird</span>.com</a>

  a. Thanks!
> b. But now the first part just says REDACTED.
  c. But now the second part is blacked out.

#aaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadcbbbb

Yes, that's correct.

  a. Thanks!
