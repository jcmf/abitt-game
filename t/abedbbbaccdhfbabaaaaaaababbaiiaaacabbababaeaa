  a. No they don't.
> b. I think you're misunderstanding my point.

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaabab

No I'm not.  That's what you said.  Look, the "bringing people back to life" option was <em>right there</em>.

  a. Shoot.  Can I go back?
> b. Are you seriously trying to tell me that you think you know what I meant better than I do?

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababb

Okay, maybe I'm not being <em>entirely</em> serious.

> a. Oh good.

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababba

Okay.  Say you're standing in line for the new Star Wars movie, and somebody in front of you starts complaining about chest pain, and then collapses.  What do you do first?

  a. Call 911.

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbai

Okay!  It's CPR time.  So what are you gonna do first?

  a. Check the airway for obstructions.
  b. Pull the head back to make space between the chin and the chest.
  c. Grab my mask.
  d. Form a seal between their lips and mine.
  e. Check for a pulse.
  f. See if they're breathing.
  g. Shout "ARE YOU CHOKING?" in a loud voice.
  h. Apply a tourniquet to the jugular vein.
> i. Begin chest compressions.
  j. Shout "IS THERE A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE?"
  k. Whip out my smartphone and ask Siri or Google or whatever how to do CPR.

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaii

Okay!  So you put one hand on top of the other and put the heel of the bottom hand on the person's chest, right about... where?

> a. I don't know!  This is stressful!  I'm in a stressful situation!  Can't you just, like, educate me or whatever?
  b. Hands have heels now?  I could have sworn heels were for feet.
  c. Wait, I have to touch an unconscious stranger's chest?
  d. I'm having trouble visualizing this hand position.
  e. Which one is the bottom hand?
  f. I'm panicking!  I'm panicking!

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiia

Good idea!  So I believe the deal is that you want to put the heel of your hand pretty much exactly between the nipples.

> a. OK!  What next?
  b. I am suddenly uncomfortable with this.

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiiaa

Now all you have to do is press down so hard that you crush their heart.

> a. Got it!  And after that?
  b. You can't be serious.

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiiaaa

Keep crushing their heart, to the rhythm of that one song, until the EMTs show up.

  a. Right, got it.
  b. Which song?
> c. Wait.  EMTs?

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiiaaac

Emergency medical technicians.  You remembered to call 911, right?

> a. Uh...

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiiaaaca

It's okay, somebody over by the drinking fountain called them and they're on their way.  But try to remember to get that started earlier next time, okay?  This is not an ideal situation you've gotten yourself into here.

  a. Okay, I'll remember.
> b. I <span class="redacted">$@^#</span>ed up, didn't I?  This person's going to die now and it's going to be my fault because I <span class="redacted">$@^#</span>ed it up.  <span class="redacted">$@^#</span>!

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiiaaacab

First off, no, they're not going to die.  And second, even if they somehow did, it wouldn't be your fault.  You are doing the best you can here.

  a. I guess that's true, isn't it?
> b. Bullshit.  I could have done better.  I could have remembered to call 911.  How hard is it to remember something like that?

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiiaaacabb

Pretty hard!  It can be hard to think of stuff like that in the moment.  You don't have to be so hard on yourself, though.  It's not like you set out to murder this person by doing the wrong thing, is it?

> a. I guess not.
  b. Actually....

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiiaaacabba

Then you did your best!  Plus it totally worked, you saved their life by doing CPR until help arrived, and now you're basically a hero.  Are you okay with that?

  a. Yes.
> b. No.

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiiaaacabbab

What do you want, then?  A pony?

> a. Yes.
  b. No.

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiiaaacabbaba

Okay!  You are now the proud owner of a pretty pink pony!  Your pony loves you so much!

  a. Thanks!
> b. But I wanted a blue pony.

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiiaaacabbabab

Too bad.  There's no such thing.

> a. Zounds!

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiiaaacabbababa

Which of the following won the most XYZZY awards?

  a. Aotearoa.
  b. Cryptozookeeper.
  c. Slouching Towards Bedlam.
  d. Zombie Exodus.
> e. What's a XYZZY award?

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiiaaacabbababae

You're breaking character, Ms. Vedenoja.

> a. Oops!

#abedbbbaccdhfbabaaaaaaababbaiiaaacabbababaea

Okay, looks like that's it.  Thank you for playing this game, Jenni.

> a. My pleasure.
  b. You're welcome.
  c. What a satisfying conclusion!
