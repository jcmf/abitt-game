#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaciaaac

Emergency medical technicians.  From when you called 911 earlier.

  a. Oh, right.

#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaciaaacb

Well then whoever this is will most likely die.

  a. Okay.

  c. But they're going to show up, right?

#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaciaaacbb

Yes.  Yes it is.

  a. Thank you for acknowledging that!

#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaciaaacbbb

Nope.  Not your fault.  You did what you could.

  a. That's true.
> b. But I could have done more.

#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaciaaacbbbb

We're not even talking about this hypothetical scenario anymore, are we?

  a. Yes we are.
  b. No.  We're not.
> c. I don't even know anymore.

#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaciaaacbbbbc

It's always tempting to say "I could have done more," because it always <em>seems</em> like... I mean you can <em>imagine</em> having done more, right?  Just one teeny little thing?  But at a certain point it stops being true.  Just because you can easily imagine something doesn't make it <em>possible</em>.  Much as you might wish otherwise, you can only do so much.  You did your best.  Okay?

  a. Yeah, okay.  I did my best.
> b. No.  It's not okay.  There is nothing about this that is okay.

#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaciaaacbbbbcb

I'm sorry.

  a. Thanks.
> b. <span class="redacted">$@^#</span> you.

#aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaciaaacbbbbcbb

Okay, looks like that's it.  Thank you for playing this game, Emily.

  a. My pleasure.
  b. You're welcome.
  c. What a satisfying conclusion!
  d. Hold on, I have a question!
